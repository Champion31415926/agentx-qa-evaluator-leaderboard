  "feedback": "The student's description of how a car's brakes stop the vehicle is inaccurate and demonstrates significant gaps in understanding the braking process. The explanation provided does not align with any of the key criteria and introduces incorrect concepts, such as the car spraying oil onto the road. It is essential to revisit the fundamentals of the braking system, including the role of the brake pedal, hydraulic fluid, calipers, brake pads, and the conversion of kinetic energy into heat through friction.",

      "comment": "The description provided does not accurately represent how a car's brakes function. The term 'button' is misleading, and there is no mention of hydraulic fluid or the pedal. It is essential to understand the role of the brake pedal and hydraulic fluid in the braking process.",
      "reflexion_log": "**THESIS:** The student mentions the driver pressing a button, but it is not clear if this is related to the brake pedal. \n**ANTITHESIS:** The student's description does not accurately describe the process of hydraulic fluid transferring pressure. The use of 'button' instead of 'pedal' and the absence of 'hydraulic fluid' indicate a significant lack of understanding. Given the balanced strictness level, this inaccuracy is significant. \n**SYNTHESIS:** The student's description does not align with the core concept, and the strictness level requires a more accurate description.",
