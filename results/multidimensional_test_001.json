The concept is understood, but technical terminology is lacking. \n**SYNTHESIS:** Since the idea is correct but lacks precise technical terms, the score is partial.",

However, at a strictness level of 0.4, the focus is on understanding the process rather than using all technical terms. \n**SYNTHESIS:** The concept is grasped, but the explanation could benefit from including the role of calipers for full accuracy.",
